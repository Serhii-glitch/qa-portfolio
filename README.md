## About Me

I am a QA Engineer with experience in both manual and automated testing. I have hands-on experience in designing and executing test cases, reporting and tracking bugs, and managing test suites in Jira.  

In addition to manual testing, I have worked with test automation using **Playwright** and **Cypress** with **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**. I have experience testing **APIs** and working with **SQL** databases to validate and query data.  

I am passionate about ensuring software quality through a combination of thorough testing, automation, and clear documentation, always aiming to deliver reliable and maintainable solutions.
